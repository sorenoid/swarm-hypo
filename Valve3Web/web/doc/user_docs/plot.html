<h1><a href="#top"><img border="0" src="../images/topnavnobg.gif"></a><span class="top"> Interacting with Graphs</span></h1>
<p>[Note - currently this text is simply a copy of what is in <a href="index.html">home</a>.]</p>
<p>Most graphs that Valve produces allow extensive interaction.  These graphs can be used to select time intervals on other graphs, select map bounding boxes, earthquake cross-sections.  In general, a time-series graph will look something like the figure below (a time-series of a tilt event).</p>
<p><center><img alt="Example time-series graph" border="1" src="graph.png"></center></p>
<p>To select a subset of the time represented on the x-axis in this graph simply move the mouse over the graph (a red line and crosshair cursor will appear) and click the time the start and end times respectively.  A green marker arrow will appear over the start time you selected and a red arrow over the end time.  Or to set the time interval to exactly what is on the x-axis, click the clock icon on the graph menu bar.  Of course, graphs that don't have time as the x-axis (like a frequency power chart) will not allow this.  This functionality allows the user to quickly look at interesting time intervals on a variety of different instruments or to find interesting events and plot them in other, perhaps more insightful, ways.  For example, a user could plot earthquake counts over a region for the last 25 years, select a time interval that has a swarm, then plot the swarm's hypocenters on an earthquake map.</p>
<p>Valve also produces many spatial plots.  These plots can be interacted with to select area boundaries, assuming that the tab currently visible is 'interested' in boundary selection.  A spatial graph will look something like the figure below (a hypocenter plot of a dike intrusion).</p>
<p><center><img alt="Example spatial graph" border="1" src="spatial.png"></center></p>
<p>If the Valve UI was open to a tab that was interested in spatial boundaries or other user-selected spatial information, clicking on the spatial graph would provide that input.  In the case of selecting a boundary for an earthquake plot, for example, simply click on the upper-left corner of the new boundary (a rubber-band type box will appear), then click on the lower-right.  Unfortunately, due to browsers interpreting a dragged mouse as a drag-and-drop event, dragging (the intuitive way of selecting a space) the clicked mouse will not work.</p>
<p><a name="rawdata"></a><b>Raw Data</b><br>
If you selected raw data output in the common panel a link will be provided in the title bar of the graph to that raw data.  To save the data to your computer, right-click on the link and select "Save link as..." or the equivalent in whatever browser you are using.</p>
<p><a name="postscript"></a><b>PostScript</b><br>
If you selected PostScript output in the common panel a link will be provided in the title bar of the graph to a PostScript file.  This file can be loaded into programs like Adobe Illustrator in order to produce publication quality plots.  To save the file to your computer, right-click on the link and select "Save link as..." or the equivalent in whatever browser you are using.</p>
