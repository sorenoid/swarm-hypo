GPS Vertical Velocities
-----------------------

Re-enabled the Vertical Velocity Field Option on GPS plots, which
controls the display of a vertical velocity vector. Error bars are
included on the vectors.

This is controlled by the vs.N parameter of the request URL, where N is
the number of the plot component, and the value is either true or false.
