Cross-sections for Earthquake Hypocenters
-----------------------------------------

Two new types of Axes requests were added: Arbitrary-Depth and
Arbitrary-Time.  These allow the user, by clicking 2 points on a map, to
specify an arbitrary plane to be plotted from, where the first click
identifies the left edge of the plot and the second the right.  If the
width is greater than 0, then the rectangle by going up to width km from
either side of that line is used to drap the hypocenters to be plotted;
if the width is 0, then the two points are taken to be the opposite
corners of the rectangle to be plotted from.

The hypowidth.N parameter of the request URL specifies the width of plot
component N in km. The axes.N parameter is set to A for arbitrary depth,
and T for arbitrary time.
