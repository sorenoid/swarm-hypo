Data Manipulation
-----------------

A standard menu for data manipulation options has been added.  It
presents 4 stages of processing:

1) Despiking, using a running mean.  If selected, a period (in seconds)
must be specified. 
2) Linear detrending. 
3) A filter stage, which can employ either a bandpass filter (with
specified maximum and minimum frequencies, either of which can be
unspecified and thus leave out the corresponding limit), a running
median or a running mean (either of which would require a period, in
seconds, to be supplied).
4) Debiasing, which can either remove the mean, the initial value, or a
user-supplied value.

Any subset, from none to all and every combination in between, of the
stages can be selected.  Stages will be applied in the order they are
listed above.

The following request parameters control these options:

despike (T/F)
despike_period (number, of seconds)
detrend (T/F)
dmo_fl (0-none, 1=bandpass, 2=median, 3=mean)
dmo_filter_arg1 (max freq for bandpass, period for median & mean)
dmo_filter_arg2 (min freq for bandpass)
dmo_db (0=none, 1=mean, 2=inital, 3=user)
debias_period (user value for debias)
