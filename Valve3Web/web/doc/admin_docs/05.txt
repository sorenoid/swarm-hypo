DB Structures for Processed Data
--------------------------------

A new section has been added to most datasource menus, "Supplementary
Data".  This is information that is time-related data that is not part
of the plottable information (typically because it is not numeric), but
related to it.   Any supplementary data selected when a plot is
requested will be indicated on the generated plot by vertical bars
within the graph associated with that data; the bar for the start time
will be solid with a right-pointing triangle at its base, while that at
the end time will be dashed with a left-facing triangle at its base. 
The value of that supplementary data can be viewed by clicking on the
triangle at the bottom of either line.

Similar data which is not time-related is available for viewing from the
generated plot by clicking on the "PD" (processing data) icon in the
plot's title bar; re-clicking that icon will trun off the viewer.
