	This program performs the same function as a request for CSV data from a VALVE plot: the data behind the plot is produced in a comma-separated value (CSV) file, written to standard out.  
	
	The following arguments are required:
	
	-channel CHANNEL_NAME
	-source DATASOURCE_NAME
	-start YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.XXX: The start date/time from which to draw data
	
	The following arguments are optional; if left out, appropriate defaults are used:
	
	-column COLUMN_NAME: This can be supplied more than once, to request multiple columns; duplicates are not allowed.
	-datatype DATATYPE: This can be supplied more than once, to request multiple types of data; duplicates are not allowed.
	-end YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.XXX: The end date/time until which to draw data.
	-rank RANK_NAME
	-timezone TIMEZONE

exportMeta.pl:

	This program exports metadata into a comma-separated value (CSV) file whose name is of the form meta_SRC.csv, where SRC is replaced with the name of the data source.
	
	The following arguments are required:
	
	-channel CHANNEL_NAME
	-source DATASOURCE_NAME
	
	The following arguments are optional; if left out, appropriate defaults are used:
	
	-column COLUMN_NAME
	-rank RANK_NAME

exportSupp.pl:

	This program exports supplemental data into a comma-separated value (CSV) file whose name is of the form supp_SRC_TIME.csv, where SRC is replaced with the name of the data source and TIME is the value given as the -start argument.
	
	The following arguments are required:
	
	-source DATASOURCE_NAME
	-start YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.XXX: The start date/time from which to draw data
	
	The following arguments are optional; if left out, appropriate defaults are used:
	
	-channel CHANNEL_NAME
	-column COLUMN_NAME
	-column COLUMN_NAME
	-type SUPPDATATYPE
	-end YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.XXX: The end date/time until which to draw data.
	-rank RANK_NAME
	-tz TIMEZONE

importMeta.pl:

	This program takes one or more files containing metadata and adds them into VDX.
	
	The following argument is optional:
	
	-c CONFIG_FILE: The name of a file to use instead the standard VDX config file.
	
	Any remaining arguments are considered to be filenames, and must be of the same form as files produced by exportMeta.pl: meta_SRC.csv, where SRC is a datasource name.
	

importSupp.pl:

	This program takes one or more files containing supplemental data and adds them into VDX.
